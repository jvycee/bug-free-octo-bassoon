        <p>
          Hey there! I'm Jaycee Lewis, a community manager and artist based in
          Albuquerque, New Mexico. For the last 5 years, I've been on a mission
          to help creatives flourish. My passion revolves around guiding others
          to nurture their creative practice, proving that even dedicating 20
          minutes a day can spark incredible transformations.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a community manager, I cultivate spaces where artists connect and
          collaborate, such as Instagram and Threads. Being an artist myself, I
          deeply understand the artistic journey. I'm a firm believer in the
          power of small daily commitments, which is why I write blogs,
          newsletters, and create courses and books that inspire individuals to
          embrace their artistic identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside the creative realm, I find joy in cooking, hiking, and
          photography. These activities not only fuel my inspiration but also
          ground me in the beauty of the world. I also have a knack for coding
          simple websites, a skill that lets me share my creative endeavors
          effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for getting to know me! I'm excited about the chance to connect
          and collaborate with fellow creatives. Feel free to reach out if
          you're interested in discussing building your creative practice, art,
          community building.
